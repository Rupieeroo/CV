## Bio

I am a Full-stack software developer with an interest in consistant learning, data visualisation, clean code and using tech for good. I believe in transparancy, communication and open-source development.

Having trained at the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain and spending my early years treading the boards, I began my journey towards development by attempting to make a rehearsal app for actors with a friend of mine. The idea being that actors could record their lines into a digital script and have the other characters lines (recorded by other actors) play on their ques, meaning that you could rehearse your role at any time, anywhere. I was in charge of marketing, research and building the professional connections around our product. We partnered with MBJ London for the UX design.

We ended up working with Hambro Perks Ltd to work out our rapid growth strategy which was an enlightening and exilerating experience. After several years of both personal and product development, me and my partner decided to put Act One to one side while we focus on our own growth. I decided to travel around Europe with just my wife and my motorcycle. While out there I spent my free time learning to code. Starting with HTML, CSS, then working through Javascript and Solidity. Upon my return to London I knew what direction I was heading in and applied for Makers Academy. Joining the October 2018 cohort and graduating as a Full-Stack Developer.

#### Makers Academy (October 2018 - December 2018)

- **Curious and passionate about code** - https://github.com/Rupieeroo/Fizz-Buzz-in-Python

  My first step towards Python mastery (this sounded less weird in my head). A Test-driven Fizz Buzz Challenge in the Python     language, after learning React I will be moving onto Python courses.

- **Fast, independent learner** - https://github.com/Rupieeroo/React-Testing
 
  This is my React playground, currently I am spending 2 hours a day teaching myself React through a Udemy Course. From here I   am planning on creating a single-page portfolio site. 
  
- **Great collaborator** - https://github.com/Rupieeroo/developer-pub-quiz

  My group's final project for Makers Academy is a two-player pub quiz that was developed by a team of four. None of us had     much experience with React and i certainly didn't understand how to integrate APIs but we managed to pull the app off within   a two week period utilizing Agile development processes.

## Skills

- Adaptability and adept at self-management under pressure 

- A genuine love and curiosity for technology and its advancement

- Team-oriented (4 years of trying to make an app from nothing with just one other person every day has taught me a lot about synergy!)

- Encyclopedic knowledge of Lovecraft, Video Game Lore and Eastern-European History (Ask me about the Battle of Karánsebes)

- Communication & Candor

- Creative Thinking and Writing

#### Communication & Candor

In between theatre jobs (and the occasional tv job which I hope will dissapear quietly into my past), I worked many varied service jobs. From working for a high-end catering company, searving giant corperate events, to award-winning and unbelieveably busy pubs, to quiet gin bars to theatre ushering. Across all of these jobs I have picked up and learnt that the single most important skill in any service job is communication. Most of the time things have to happen at lightning speed and if someone doesn't know something it can collapse the entire event. I like to think I have developed a good understanding of theimportance of communicating, especially when the pressure sets in.

I also speak conversational Hungarian. Which in itself is a communication feat I still can't believe I've accomplished!

I also spent many years keeping how I fealt in any situation to myself, believing that it shouldn't matter to anyone but me. Over time I learnt that being candid and open about what i am thinking and feeling has changed the way I see myself and helped me in every aspect of my life. This is an attitude that underlines everything I do and I take honesty as one of the most important skills I have developed.

#### Creative Thinking and Writing

Most of my life has been spent in and around the theatre. I have worked in every capacity: an actor, a director, a writer and a producer and, sometimes, a mix of all of them. 

What I learnt during these years is that theatre is about relaying a message and getting the audience to think and re-think. I have conducted the marketing for various shows around London based at the Vaults and the Kiln (previously the Tricycle) theatres and have had to reason out situations as they happen. Making sure the show goes on when an actor is suddenly taken ill is an exillerating albeit terrifying experience and such things happen all the time in the arts.

- I breifly kept a blog to experiment with writing during my year in Europe, utilizing my creative thinking:

## Education

- Makers Academy

- National Youth Theatre of Great Britain

- Alton College

- Bedales School

#### Hobbies and Other Skills.

- As mentioned above, I am currently studying Hungarian. Having lived in both Budapest and Debrecen I have grown fond of this   unique and bizarre langauge and look forward to getting better at it.

- I ride a fixed-gear Bicycle around London (with a front break, I'm not crazy) and am currently trying to get into better       shape to start racing competitively.

- I have both a driving and motorcycle (A2) licence and have ridden a Triumph Bonneville T120 across Europe (8000 miles in       total) reaching Bosnia and Transylvania before eventually coming back to the UK.

- I am currently in the research phase of writing a history book about the break-up of Austria-Hungary. My goal is to           highlight how important it is to take a different view of events then the ones we are taught. I'm hoping to make the book     humerous. Or about as humerous as a horrifying World War can be anyway.

- I dabble in graphic design, having made a poster in the form of a Nintendo game cover for a West-End Musical to my             #Windowaday project on Instagram: @Rupieeroo. This has been put on hold while I focus on my job hunt.

- I have a Boston Terrier named Steve. I have taught him tricks and I think that his hi-five might be my proudest achievement   to date.

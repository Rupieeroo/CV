- **Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, React, Python**

  I have spent the last four months learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails for back-end and Javascript, with frameworks such as         JQuery and React for the front-end development. From here I am teaching myself more advanced React skills, data structures     in Javascript and eventually will move onto learning more python.
  
- **RSpec, Jasmine, Cypress, pytest**

  I test drive all of my code to the best of my ability and thoroughly enjoy using tests as specification and passing said       tests.
  
- **OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD**

  Having gotten to grips with various programming processes and concepts, I enjoy keeping my code manageable, readable and       meaningful. The ability to create complex systems from simple ones and then be able to brake them down again is something I   strive for in every project I work on.

- **Agile Develpment**

  I work well under pressure and with responsibility and cannot wait to work within an agile environment.
  
## Bio

I am a Full-stack software developer with an interest in consistent learning, data visualisation, clean code and using tech for good. I believe in transparency, communication and open-source development.

Having trained at the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain and spending my early years treading the boards, I began my journey towards development by attempting to make a rehearsal app for actors with a friend of mine. The idea being that actors could record their lines into a digital script and have the other characters lines (recorded by other actors) play on their cues, meaning that you could rehearse your role at any time, anywhere. I was in charge of operations, research and building the professional connections around our product. We partnered with [MBJ London](https://mbj.london/ "MBJ London") for the UX design.

[Act One Interactive's current site](https://www.actoneinteractive.co.uk/)

We ended up working with [Hambro Perks Ltd](https://www.hambroperks.com/ "Hambro Perks Ltd") to work out our rapid growth strategy which was an enlightening and exhilerating experience. After several years of both personal and product development, me and my partner decided to put Act One to one side while we focus on our own growth. I decided to travel around Europe with just my wife and my motorcycle. While out there I spent my free time learning to code. Starting with HTML, CSS, then working through Javascript and Solidity. Upon my return to London I knew what direction I was heading in and applied for Makers Academy. Joining the October 2018 cohort and graduating as a Full-Stack Developer.

#### Makers Academy (October 2018 - December 2018)

- **Curious and passionate about code** - https://github.com/Rupieeroo/Fizz-Buzz-in-Python

  My first step towards Python mastery (this sounded less weird in my head). A Test-driven Fizz Buzz Challenge in the Python     language, after learning React I will be moving onto Python courses.

- **Fast, independent learner** - https://github.com/Rupieeroo/React-Testing
 
  This is my React playground, currently I am spending 2 hours a day teaching myself React through a Udemy Course. From here I   am planning on creating a single-page portfolio site. 
  
- **Great collaborator** - https://github.com/Rupieeroo/developer-pub-quiz

  My group's final project for Makers Academy is a two-player pub quiz that was developed by a team of four. None of us had     much experience with React and i certainly didn't understand how to integrate APIs but we managed to pull the app off within   a two week period utilizing Agile development processes.

## Skills

- **Communication and candor**

My belief is that communication is key to growth. Whether that is in a team, a relationship, with yourself etc. I put communication above everything.

- **Adaptability and self-management under pressure**

Running a start-up and service industry experience has taught me how to manage my time and energy while under pressure.

- **Team-Oriented progress**

No man is an island, but if I was I would be in an archipelago.

- **A genuine love and curiosity for technology and its advancement**

I am fascinated by technological advancement and embrace new ideas and concepts as they come. Currently I am working on my Ethereum and blockchain understanding.

- **Creative thinking and writing**

Most of my life has been spent in and around the theatre. I have worked in every capacity: an actor, a director, a writer and a producer and, sometimes, a mix of all of them. This has helped me develop an 'out of the box' mentality to problem-solving and creation.

 A section of a review I wrote for the Slovenian National Theatre Festival (Boštnikovo) on their website:
 https://www.2010-2016.borstnikovo.si/en/news-festival-2015/our-guestss-opinions-are-here/

 I breifly kept a blog to experiment with writing during my year in Europe, utilizing my creative thinking:
 http://pufferandsauce.blogspot.com/

- **Massive geek**

I have an encyclopedic knowledge of Lovecraft, Video Game Lore and Eastern-European History (Ask me about the Battle of Karánsebes).

## Education

- Makers Academy

- National Youth Theatre of Great Britain

- Alton College

- Bedales School

## Hobbies and Other Skills.

- As mentioned above, I am currently studying Hungarian. Having lived in both Budapest and Debrecen I have grown fond of this   unique and bizarre langauge and look forward to getting better at it.

- I dabble in graphic design, having made a poster in the form of a Nintendo game cover for a West-End Musical to my             #Windowaday project on Instagram: @Rupieeroo. This has been put on hold while I focus on my job hunt.

- I have a Boston Terrier named Steve. I have taught him tricks and I think that his hi-five might be my proudest achievement   to date.

- I have both a driving and motorcycle (A2) licence and have ridden a Triumph Bonneville T120 across Europe (8000 miles in       total) reaching Bosnia and Transylvania before eventually coming back to the UK.

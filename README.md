## Rupert Adams

I am a Full-stack software developer with an interest in consistent learning, data visualisation, clean code and using tech for good. I believe in transparency, communication and open-source development.
Having trained at the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain and spending my early years treading the boards, I began my journey towards development by co-founding Act One Interactive, a rehearsal app for actors. I was in charge of operations, research and building the professional connections around our product, partnering with Hambro Perks Ltd to facilitate our rapid growth strategy.

## Skills

### Adaptability

Most of my life has been spent in and around the theatre in every capacity: actor, director, writer and producer and sometimes a mix of all of them.  At Makers, I’ve got comfortable moving between technologies and teams fast. In an agile project team at Makers, we created a two-player pub quiz using React and integrating APIs for the first time.

### A genuine curiosity for technology

I began learning HTML and CSS while travelling through Europe and returned excited to start a career in tech and enrolled at Makers. Since graduating,  I have been learning React and experimented with Python.

### Writing

I have always enjoyed writing within and for the theatre, whether it’s a review for the [National Slovenian Theatre](https://www.2010-2016.borstnikovo.si/en/news-festival-2015/our-guestss-opinions-are-here/) or [blogging my way through a year spent traveling through Europe](http://pufferandsauce.blogspot.com/).
